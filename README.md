# Analysis-on-company-s-HR-data

## This concerns a big company that wants to understand why some of their best and most experienced employees are leaving prematurely. The company also wishes to predict which valuable employees will leave next.

This project aims at giving a full description of processes undertaken to predict the possible churn of employees in a firm. Employee attrition can be a ten million dollar problem for some companies.
Using Data Science procedures, companies can predict employees who are likely to leave and also use Exploratory Data Analysis to find patterns that can inform reasons for which employees may decide to leave. 
For this project, Python was used.
